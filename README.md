How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? Out of the various ways to interpret user needs, the one that has worked well for me is during the initial phase of gathering information. Instead of asking generic questions, it’s better to come well-equipped and having researched the user beforehand. This will inform your work on the application and help you to ascertain whether someone will be a good fit for your team considering their interests and expertise. From there, you can begin using the product backlog to create user stories. This may mean you have to determine the needs of the user, the team members and project. This will give the team a comprehensive list of tasks.
	
	How do I approach developing programs? The way that works best for me is by making an outline of the whole project as opposed to just taking it step by step. It also helps to make unique sprints of the program development process. As I work on a project I’m testing it and troubleshooting to make sure all the sprints work harmoniously.

What does it mean to be a good team member? Someone who can finish their required tasks and move on to helping the team. Of course, one should always prioritize their own work first before helping another. A good team member should be able to contribute to team meetings and should be receptive to feedback.
